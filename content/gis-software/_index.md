# GIS software

For most GIS and thematic mapping uses we recommend QGIS. We strongly recommend the Long Term Release (LTR) version.

We like QGIS because it's:

- professional quality software
- actively maintained by a large number of contributors
- supported by a number of sponsors
- open source (GPL)
- not restricted by licensing requirements (\*cough\*ArcGIS\*cough\*)
- stable
- what we used for our PhDs!
