My (Phil) favourite source for census data because of it's RESTful API, so it's possible to search for, obtain, and download data programmatically. This saved me a *ton* of time during my PhD.


## Census years

- 2011
- 2001
- 1991
- 1981


## Country(ies) available

- England
- Wales


## API?

Yes - https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/api/v01/help


## Notes

- Ensure you [register](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/myaccount/userjoin.asp). It's free, and means you can use public and private API keys. Without these there's a limit to how many data cells you can download, so this will save you having to split files.
