## About us

We are a group of three human geographers who met while we were studying for our PhDs at the University of Sheffield.
We are:

- Phil Mike Jones
- Tom Broomhead
- Amber Wilson

We started this site because finding good quality geographical data, especially for small geographies, is challenging.
This site is a curated collection of geographical data sets and resources that we think will be useful to geographers and other researchers interested in understanding small areas.
