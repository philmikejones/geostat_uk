## Guidance

- We prefer items which have open licences, such as Creative Commons, Open Government License, or equivalents. That said we do consider non-open items, especially if there isn't a good open alternative.
- Please include as much of the following information in your submissions as possible:
  - Who you are (so you can be credited). A github or twitter handle is fine.
  - URI of the resource
  - What terms is it licensed under?
  - Does it have an API?
  - What type of data set is it? Boundary data, aggregate data, etc.?
  - What date(s) does the data cover?
  - Anything else that's useful to know?


## Contributor code of conduct
